1. Develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect defects in conveyor belts, including material defects, tracking variances, and splice defects.
  a. This model should be able to process data from sensors in real-time or near real-time, and classify the defects according to their type and severity.

2. Aggregate and classify the defects detected by the machine learning model.
  a. This would involve organizing the data from the sensors and the machine learning model into a comprehensive system, and using this data to categorize the defects according to their type and severity.

3. Implement the machine learning model and defect detection system in an Amazon fulfillment center for testing.
  a. This would involve integrating the system with the existing conveyor belt systems in the fulfillment center, and conducting tests to evaluate its performance and make any necessary adjustments.

4. Develop a user interface for the system, including real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities.
  a. This would involve creating a dashboard that displays the data from the sensors and the machine learning model, allowing technicians to quickly and easily identify any potential issues with the conveyor belts.

5. Integrate the system with the existing conveyor belt systems in the fulfillment center.
  a. This would involve ensuring that the sensors, control system, and user interface are compatible with the conveyor belts, and that they can be easily integrated into the existing operations of the fulfillment center.

6. Conduct testing of the system in the fulfillment center to evaluate its performance and make any necessary adjustments.
  a. This would involve using the system in a real-world setting to identify and address any potential issues, and making any necessary changes to improve its performance.

7. Provide training to technicians on how to use and maintain the system.
  a. This would involve creating training materials and conducting workshops to ensure that technicians are familiar with the system and can use it effectively.

8. Create documentation for the system, including user manuals and technical specifications.
  a. This would involve producing detailed guides and specifications for the system, including instructions on how to use and maintain it.

9. Provide ongoing support and maintenance for the system as needed.
  a. This would involve responding to any issues or requests from technicians, and providing updates and improvements to the system as needed.

10. Design and build a fixture to house the camera, computer, lighting, and rub plate for the defect detection system.
  a. This would involve creating a physical structure that can support and protect the components of the defect detection system, and ensuring that it is compatible with the existing conveyor belt systems in the fulfillment center.

11. Test the fixture to ensure that it provides the necessary support and stability for the defect detection system.
  a. This would involve conducting tests to evaluate the performance of the fixture, and making any necessary adjustments
